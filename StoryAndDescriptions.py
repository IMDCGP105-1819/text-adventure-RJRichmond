StartingStory = """
You arrive outside of a rundown building, you don't remember the way you got here since you got lost in the woods
while asking for directions on the closest town. The building looks ancient with vines seeping out of every crack,
it looks as no one has been here in generations as nature has taken its toll on it.
"""

EnterPorch = """
You enter the building after pushing open the towering mahogany doors, the creaking noise as it opens pierces your ears,
as you step in you notice the air is thick and it makes it hard to breath.
"""

EnterKitchen = """
You Walk into the Kitchen, however you get a cold sweat pass through your body as the room gives a completely different,
vibe. Everything is clean and kept in a good manner, there is pots and pans on the walls which are sparkling clean.
It's almost like someone is still uses this room often. You see a bookcase at the edge of the room, it has an empty picture frame
sitting on it.

"""

PorchDescription = """ now inside of the building you still can't make out what the purpose of the building was,
only that you were right about it being uninhabitated, there is shattered glass on the floor and thick layers
of dust blanketing everything. You notice a picture on the shelf.
"""

KitchenDescription = """ inside a grand kitchen, it seems strangely clean inside,
the dust which is coating the porch is nowhere to be seen, it makes you feel uneasy as
someone else might have come through or still maintains this room. You do notice an empty picture frame sitting on a bookshelf.
"""

StudyDescription = """ in the middle of the study, it is filled with books and what seem to be papers spread out around the room,
there is a desk in the center of the room which has key sitting on it, it looks quite important!

PictureDescription = """
You picked up a picture which was sitting on the side, you wipe away the dust to find that a women must have lived here,
the picture has yellowed with age.
"""
PictureUse = """
You remove the dust and webs off of the picture frame and then put in the picture which you found on the shelf,
suddenly you hear some mechanisms and a bookshelf shifts, revealing a doorway!
 """

keyDescription = """
You picked up a key, it looks quite old as the rust on it almost makes it look bronze.
 """

keyUse = """
You put the key into the lockbox and turn it, to your surprise the lockbox pings open and it contains a lighter,
it doesn't seem to have much fluid for a lot of uses so I should save it for something.
 """

lighterDescription = """
You picked up the lighter from the lockbox, it looks fairly modern however it is incredibly light and it doesn't,
seem to have much fluid left in itself.
 """

 lighterUse = """
You light all of the candles in the room, suddenly you hear another mechanism moving, it reveals a trap door which was hidden,
underneath a rug, you are wondering what in the house is left to find and what are they hiding.
