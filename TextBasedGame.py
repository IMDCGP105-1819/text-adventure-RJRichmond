# -- Running the game

# Here I am printing the opening to the story, and I am also creating the character variable and setting the inventory to have a blank object since the way I have done the classes,
# the item checking, dropping and using, requires rooms and the player to atleast have an item in the lists. I have set the character's x and y position to 0.
print(StartingStory)
Character = Character([Item("",Placeholder,Placeholder)],0,0)
# I also set the character position variable to have a default of 0,0
CharacterPosition = [0,0]

# This while loop is what allows the game to play as it will keep running unless broken. So in this loop I have a check to see if the game has finished using the "GameEnded" function, I then have a variable which stores user inputs.
# and then I use the input checker function which goes through and makes everything word accordingly, I also make sure to set all of the user inputs to lowercase at it keeps all of the words consistent and doesn't cause trouble with caps.
while True:
    if (GameEnded == True):
        print("Game Ended, Thanks for playing!")
        break
    UserInput = str(input("Please enter a command : "))
    InputCheck(UserInput.lower())
